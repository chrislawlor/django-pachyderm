Django Pachyderm
================

A set (well, one for now) of Django Fields for PostgreSQL special data types.

Currently, only ArrayField is supported, but support for JSON and UUID types
is coming soon :)

Why?
----

There are a few other custom field libraries around. Why use Pachyderm?

Well Tested
~~~~~~~~~~~

Pachyderm fields will be tested on every version of Python which is supported
by every version of Django. No surprises.


Comprehensive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well, it isn't yet, but will be soon.


Fun
~~~

'Pachyderm' is fun to say :)
